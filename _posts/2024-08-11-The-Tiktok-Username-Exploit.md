## The TikTok Username Exploit

Recently, a new tiktok exploit has been discovered to get any taken usernames. I'll teach you how to use it.

## Requirements

1. Python 3x or newer
2. EditThisCookie browser extension for Google Chrome
3. A tiktok account

## Step 1: Get your SessionID

Firstly, you have to get your TikTok account's session ID.

You can do this by logging in to your tiktok account, then opening EditThisCookie's menu and search for sessionID value, click on it and copy the content.


## Step 2: Download the username changer

Once you copy the sessionID, you have to download the python file which will change your username

## Step 3: Setup

Once you opened the python file, paste in your sessionid, then when it asks you for your username you have to go to the font generator below
[FontGen](https://0xf15.github.io/custom-font/)

### Generate

Input your text in the "Enter your text here" field and click generate.
All you have to do then is press the copy text button and paste it into the username in the python program and vaila!
Many people are using this method so you might have to switch in the fontgen between beginning, end, middle, random for it to not error you.


Hope you found this useful!
